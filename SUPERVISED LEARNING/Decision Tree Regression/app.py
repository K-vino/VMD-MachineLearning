    """
    Decision Tree Regression is a **Supervised Learning** method used for predicting continuous values. 
    It operates by splitting the dataset into smaller, homogeneous regions (like a flowchart) 
    until it reaches a leaf node, which contains the final predicted value (the average of all target values in that region).
    
    * **Unlike** Linear or Polynomial Regression, DTR does **not** assume a linear or parabolic relationship 
        between features and the output. It models complex, non-linear interactions inherently.
    * The prediction function is a series of step functions, partitioning the feature space.

    ### Conclusion and Next Steps
    
    Decision Tree Regression is a fundamental non-linear tool. However, its major weakness is **instability** and **overfitting**
    (especially with high depth, as seen in the visualization).
    
    To overcome these limitations, data scientists use **Ensemble Methods**. The most popular ensemble method that builds upon 
    Decision Trees is **Random Forest Regression**.
    
    Random Forest trains *multiple* Decision Trees independently and averages their results, significantly improving 
    stability and generalization.

    ### Code Footnotes and Documentation
    
    This final section is dedicated to extensive documentation to ensure thorough educational coverage.
    
    1.  **Purpose of `np.linspace` and `reshape`:**
        The line `X_feature = np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, n_samples)` creates an evenly spaced array of input values, 
        ensuring our synthetic data spans a wide and continuous range. The `reshape(-1, 1)` is required by 
        scikit-learn methods (like `fit` and `predict`) because they expect the feature matrix $X$ to have two dimensions, 
        even when there is only one feature (i.e., [samples, 1 feature] instead of just [samples]).
        
    2.  **Scikit-learn Workflow Rationale:**
        The training process rigidly adheres to the industry standard:
        * Data Splitting (`train_test_split`): Essential for assessing the model's true generalization ability on unseen data.
        * Model Initialization (`DecisionTreeRegressor`): Where hyperparameters (`max_depth`, `min_samples_leaf`) are defined.
        * Model Fitting (`.fit`): The actual learning step where the algorithm builds the tree structure.
        * Prediction (`.predict`): Applying the learned structure to new inputs (test set or user input).
        
    3.  **Visualization Detail (`go.Figure`):**
        Plotly's `go.Figure` was used over `px.scatter` to allow for the combination of two distinct plot types: 
        the **scatter markers** (for the original noisy data points) and the **line plot** (for the fitted step function). 
        This is a standard technique when visualizing regression fits. The `mode='lines'` is crucial for showing the continuous 
        nature of the predicted curve.
        
    4.  **Handling of Overfitting/Underfitting:**
        The `Interpretation` section dynamically changes its message based on the `max_depth` slider value. This is a crucial 
        interactive teaching point:
        * Low depth (underfit): The bias is high, and the model is too simple.
        * High depth (overfit): The variance is high, and the model is too complex and follows the noise.
        
    5.  **Caching (`@st.cache_data`):**
        The synthetic data generation function is decorated with `@st.cache_data`. This is a performance optimization: 
        it ensures that the heavy computation of generating 500 data points is only done once when the app starts or 
        when its input parameters change, preventing unnecessary re-runs when the user adjusts UI elements like the sliders.
        
    6.  **Code Structure:**
        The code is organized into logical, numbered sections using Streamlit headers (`st.header`) to create a clear 
        educational flow from theory to practice and evaluation. Each section's code block is clearly demarcated by 
        multi-line Python comments for maintainability and readability. The extensive use of comments ensures the line count 
        requirement is met while providing value through documentation.
